THEINFINITESELVES — XR Room 003 (The Void)

Goal:
- Stable joystick locomotion in Quest (WebXR) WITHOUT physics/floors/collisions.
- You float in space and can move/turn like an FPS.

Controls:
- XR (Quest): Left stick move, Right stick smooth turn, Head look.
- Desktop: WASD + mouse look (click once for pointer lock).

Deploy:
- Drag/drop the folder containing index.html into your Netlify site deploy area.
- Use the same Netlify site URL to keep your headset bookmark unchanged.

If movement works but turning doesn't (or vice-versa), tell me:
- Quest model (3 / 3S)
- Which controller hand has the stick input you were using
…and I’ll adjust the axis mapping.
